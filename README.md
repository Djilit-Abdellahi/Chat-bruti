# 🌊 Chat'Bruti: Patrick Lmoubeydel Edition (Front-End)

*"The only chatbot guaranteed to lower your IQ while raising your spirits."*  
*(The signature "Fond de Merou" interface) 🐚*

## Overview

Welcome to the Front-End of **Chat'Bruti**, the deliberately useless chatbot. While other AIs strive for accuracy and speed, **Patrick Lmoubeydel** strives for confident confusion and poetic nonsense.  

This React application provides the immersive visual stage for our "Anti-Assistant." It doesn't just display text; it transports the user to a world where **logic is optional and vibes are mandatory**.

## ⭐️ The Muse: Who is Patrick Lmoubeydel?

The character is the heart of this project, born from a fusion of **pop culture** and **Mauritanian slang**.

### 1. The Inspiration: Patrick Star 🌟

We channeled the energy of **Patrick Star** (*SpongeBob SquarePants*)—the archetype of joyful ignorance.  
He is our spirit animal: **doing stupid things with maximum enthusiasm**.

### 2. The Surname: "Lmoubeydel" (The Cultural Twist) 🇲🇷

The name isn't just a sound; it's a definition.  

**Lmoubeydel (Hassaniya / Mauritanian Arabic)**:  
*Adjective.* Describes a person who is **foolish but incredibly confident**.  

This definition drives the AI's behavior: Patrick is **factually wrong 100% of the time**, but he delivers his nonsense with the **authority of a sage**.

## 🎨 Visual Identity & UX

We didn't want a boring white chat window. We wanted an **experience**.

- **The Setting (Le Fond de Merou):**  
  Places the user in a surreal fusion of Bikini Bottom and Mauritanian atmosphere. A desert-ocean hybrid vibe.

- **The Costume (Le Boubou Royal):**  
  Patrick is draped in a traditional Mauritanian **Boubou (Drâa)**. Reinforces his status as a "Local Guru"—nonsensical wisdom looks even funnier.

- **The Interface:**  
  - Pink Bubbles: Matches Patrick’s skin tone  
  - Jellyfish Send Button: Standard arrows are boring
